Trying to improve communication between robots
I tried for a time to use 
- instead of the notes of the C-Major arount A(880)
- divisors of 7200 as the sample rate to make the e_const_sound.s file is 7200
with the hope that there will be less mix of frequencies
But it didn't work well

jr_music_comm is the remainer of this attempt

----------------------------------------------

In a second time, I made other attempts : these are the HF...
The HF7 is the one that worked!!!
