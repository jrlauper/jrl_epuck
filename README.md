The main part of this work is a demo set using 1st generation e-pucks (dsPIC) programmed in an *embedded* way <br/>
(using MPLab IDE v.5.40 and XC16 compiler v.1.50). <br/>
The demos emphasize *collective* behavior and make extensive use of e-puck *sound* capabilities (micros and speakers). 

- **Demo set**: [jr_demo](https://github.com/jrlauper/jrl_epuck/tree/master/jr_demo)
    - complete list of programs (with youtube links): [link](https://github.com/jrlauper/jrl_epuck/blob/master/jr_demo/programs-list.md)
    - youtube *playlist* of demo videos for all the demos set: [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrscHgSUZPdr38tirAsB4_4Q93khKP9Rv)

- Simple **sound library** enabling to easily produce tones from **pre-recorded** sounds: [jr_wav_music2](https://github.com/jrlauper/jrl_epuck/tree/master/jr_wav_music2)
- More **advanced** **sound library** enabling to generate any sound **"on the fly"** with more advanced features (wave shape, volume control, ...) : [jr_freq_sound](https://github.com/jrlauper/jrl_epuck/tree/master/jr_freq_sound)

The other folders are connected to material described in the [report](https://github.com/jrlauper/jrl_epuck/blob/master/Lauper%20(2020).%20E-pucks.%20Report.pdf). <br/>
Here is the *playlist* of all other demos related to the report and made for documentation purposes: [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrscHgSUZPdrjsOhXDUBphgNyq3NGuZ5R)
