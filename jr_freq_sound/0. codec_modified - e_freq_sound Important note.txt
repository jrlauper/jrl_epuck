Jean-Roch LAUPER - Sound Generator Library for epuck

[!!!] Modified Codec folder files:
----------------------------------
Being based on the audio-recording project 

    https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/E-Puck#Audio_recording
    http://projects.gctronic.com/E-Puck/DemoGCtronic-recording/DemoGCtronic-recording.zip

the e_freq_sound.c/h library uses a MODIFIED version of the CODEC folder files 
in comparison with the ones present in the standard library of the e-puck
(especially e_sub_dci_kickoff.s)
Therefore, if you uses the original codec files of the standard library
and not the ones present in this folder (they are also gathered in 
the "codec_modified") jr_sound_freq stops to work. 

In connection: you can't use this modified version of codec files 
 with projects made for the unmodified version of the standard library 
- typically the e_wav_music2 library (which uses pre-recorded sounds)
