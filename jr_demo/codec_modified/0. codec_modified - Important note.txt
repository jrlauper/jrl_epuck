JRL Summer 2019

Be careful!
***********
jr_freq_sound is based on GCtronic audio_recording project.

But,Audio_Recording uses a modified version of the codec files originally in the library.
(especially e_sub_dci_kickoff.s)
As jr_freq_sound is based on the audio_recording project -> it uses this modified version
+ some slight modifications
Therefore, if you use the codec files from the library and not this modified version,
jr_sound_freq stops to work.
In a converse way : you can't use this modified version with project made for 
the unmodified version - typically the e_wav_music2 library

=> to be able to use both the modified and unmodified version of the codec library
we should modify quite a lot of things in the assembler files

# 8 files to copy from the modified version of the codec:
    common.inc
    e_common.inc
    e_init_codec_slave.s
    e_init_dci_master.s
    e_isr_dci.s
    e_sound.h
    e_sound.c
    e_sub_dci_kickoff.s
